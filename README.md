# Meal-Recommendation-Program
A tiny program I built to help me choose my meals 

I became a vegetarian a couple of months ago, and since then I've been collecting recipes I had tried. It became quite hard not to lose track as I'm constantly adding new recipes.
So I built myself a small program to help me choose a recipe based on what ingredients I currently have. 
As for now, it's really not the easiest to use in terms of preparing the data file, but I am planning to improve this code sometime later.
